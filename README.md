# mira

mira is an open source control interface for an arbitrary number of individually addressable strip LEDs. Itâ€™s designed to make primary interactions obvious and reliable, while allowing for secondary interactions that are flexible and ridiculous. It does this by providing two primary control surfaces:

* mira panel, a physical control with three easily understood knobs
* mira app, a web interface (in development)

mira runs on the ESP32 wifi-enabled microcontroller, connected to LEDs like the WS8212B.

### Install

You'll want [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), an ESP32, and some strip LEDs.
