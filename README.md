# mira

mira is an open source control interface for an arbitrary number of individually addressable strip LEDs. Itâ€™s designed to make primary interactions obvious and reliable, while allowing for secondary interactions that are flexible and ridiculous. It does this by providing two primary control surfaces:

- mira panel, a physical control with three easily understood knobs
- mira app, a web interface (in development)

mira runs on the ESP32 wifi-enabled microcontroller, connected to LEDs like the WS8212B.

### Install

You'll want [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), an ESP32, and some strip LEDs.

You will also want to specify your wifi credentials by creating an `include/secrets.h` containing:

```cpp
#pragma once
const char *wifi_ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char *wifi_password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

```
